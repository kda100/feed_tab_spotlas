# Social Media App Feed Tab
This repository contains the code pertaining to the development of a social media feed tab containing various posts using Flutter. The app uses http requests to fetch data as a json object to produce the user interface for each post. The app uses pagination to facilitate infinite scrolling of posts and uses animations for the actions of liking posts, scrolling through images of each post and expansion of each post's captions. The UI elements of the app also respond to different screen sizes.
